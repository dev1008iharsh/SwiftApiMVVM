In Swift Language, making network calls using URLSession is a common task for fetching data from APIs. URLSession provides a convenient way to perform network operations asynchronously. ( iPhone Mobile Application Development )

I. Creating a URL Object:
Begin by creating a URL object that represents the endpoint you want to communicate with. Ensure that the URL is valid and points to the correct resource.

II. Initiating the Data Task:
Use the URL object to create a data task using the shared URLSession. The data task performs the network request asynchronously. You can customize the request by providing additional parameters such as HTTP method, headers, and more.

III. Handling the Response:
Inside the completion handler of the data task, handle the response. Check for errors, status codes, and process the received data.

IV. Resume the Task:
URLSession tasks start in a suspended state, so remember to call resume() to initiate the network request.

V. Dispatching to the Main Thread:
If your app involves UI updates based on the network response, ensure that UI-related code is executed on the main thread. You can use Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) for this purpose.

VI. Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage issues that may arise during the network call.

VII.Cancellation and Resuming:
URLSession tasks can be canceled or resumed based on your application's requirements. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to cancel a request if the user navigates away from a particular screen.

In summary, URLSession in Swift provides a flexible and powerful API for making network calls. Proper error handling, response validation, and dispatching to the main thread are essential practices for building reliable and responsive networking code in Swift.
